## Usage
This project demonstrates how to use CSS float properties to create various layouts:
- **Floated Left**: A page where an element (e.g., an image) is floated to the left, with text wrapping around it.
- **Floated Right**: A page where an element is floated to the right, with text wrapping around it.
- **Clear Both**: A page featuring two floated elements (left and right) and a third element that clears both floats.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses semantic markup with proper element nesting.
- **CSS Box Model**: Utilizes border-box mode with the `box-sizing` property.
- **Selectors**: Implements type, class, and ID selectors.
- **Display Modes**: For non-floated elements, only block, inline, and/or inline-block modes are used.
